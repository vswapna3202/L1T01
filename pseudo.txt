#An algorithm that asks the user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs
#the largest of the numbers that was input

Set flag to true
Set maxNumber to 0

loop while flag is true 

	Get positive number from user 
	
	if positive number is 0 
		set flag to false
	
	if max number is 0 or if positive number is greater than max number
		Set positive number to max number variable
	
end loop		
Print the max number

#An algorithm that requests the user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently it prints
#first_name along with the phrase " Hello World"

Input the user name and store this in variable first_name
Output first_name and "Hello World"

#An algorithm that reads arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average

input number of integers and assign it to variable n
initialise counter as 0
initialise total as 0
loop while counter is less than n
	input the number from user
	compute total as total add number
	increment counter by 1
end loop
calculate average by dividing  total by  n
return average back to user

#An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products in alphabetical order that are still left to buy

loop through every item in the grocery list
	check if item has been bought or not
	if item has not been bought add item to new list of items
end loop
sort the new list in alphabetical order
if items exists in new list
print all the items in the new list 
else
print message "all items have already been bought"


#An algorithm for the flow chart

input variables X and Y from user
Calculate S as sum of X and Y
Calculate A as S divided by 2
Calculate P as X multiplied by Y
Print the calculated variables S, A and P

The following task involves writing algorithms as psuedo code for various scenarios: 
    ○ An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly
    until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the
    largest of the numbers that were input.
    ○ An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
    stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
    algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
    World”.
    ○ An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
    returns their arithmetic average.
    ○ An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
    (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.
    ○ An algorithm that inputs variables X and Y from user, sums it up and stores  
    it in S and divides them by 2 and stores it in A. It also multiplies X and Y 
    and stores it in P. Prints calculated values of S, A and P. This algorithm was 
    interpreted from a flow chart.
